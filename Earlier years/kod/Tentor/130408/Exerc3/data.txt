You are invited to submit a full paper for consideration. All accepted
papers will be published in printed conference proceedings (ISBN)
and will also be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed
in science citation databases that track citation frequency for
each paper. Like prior years, extended versions of selected papers
(about 35%) will appear in journals and edited research books (publishers
include: Springer, Elsevier, BMC, and others).
